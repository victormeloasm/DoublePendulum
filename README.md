# Double Pendulum Simulation in MATLAB

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a double pendulum simulation. The double pendulum is a classic example in physics that exhibits chaotic behavior. This simulation allows you to visualize and analyze the motion of a double pendulum system.

## Dependencies

To run the double pendulum simulation, you need to have the following software installed:

- MATLAB (version R2023a or later)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Launch MATLAB and navigate to the directory where you cloned/downloaded the repository.
3. Open the file `double_pendulum_simulation.m` in MATLAB.
4. Adjust the simulation parameters as desired (e.g., mass, length, initial conditions) in the code.
5. Click the "Run" button or type `run` in the MATLAB command window to execute the simulation.
6. The simulation will display an animation of the double pendulum's motion and provide relevant data (e.g., positions, velocities, energies) during the simulation.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the double pendulum simulation according to your requirements:

- Adjust the simulation parameters such as masses, lengths, and initial conditions in the `double_pendulum_simulation.m` file.
- Modify the visualization settings (e.g., colors, line widths) in the code to change the appearance of the animation.
- Extend the simulation to include additional forces or constraints by modifying the equations of motion in the code.
